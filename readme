The codes and datasets we used in our experimental evaluations are given here.

1. utility_functions.py contains the data loaders, constraints and functions.
	a. get_graph_data() loads the graphs for the experiment in section "How Effective is DISTORTED-STREAMING?"
	b. get_video_frames_data() loads the data for video summarizing application.
	c. loadTwitterData() loads the twitter datasets.
	d. get_movie_data() loads the data for the movie rating application
	e. get_yelp_data() loads the yelp dataset with the distance of each location to each POI.

2. algorithms.py contains the submodular maximization algorithms we use.

3. graph_application.py script reproduce and plots the experiments of the section How Effective is DISTORTED-STREAMING?"

4. yelp_application.py script runs the Yelp location summarization application.

5. mode_finding.py runs the mode finding application.
